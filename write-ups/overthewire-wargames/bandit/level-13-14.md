# Level 13 → 14

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in <mark style="color:orange;">/etc/bandit\_pass/bandit14</mark> and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
