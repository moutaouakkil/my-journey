# Level 17 → 18

## Level Goal

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: <mark style="color:orange;">passwords.old</mark> and <mark style="color:orange;">passwords.new</mark>. The password for the next level is in <mark style="color:orange;">passwords.new</mark> and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

**NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19**
