Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, follows a structured approach to identify and address vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. The ethical hacking process typically involves the following five stages:

### Reconnaissance:

* Gather information about target system/network
* Use passive techniques (public info, websites, DNS records)
* Goal: Understand target and identify entry points



### Scanning:

* Actively probe target for vulnerabilities
* Use tools for port scanning, network mapping
* Identify potential weaknesses



### Gaining Access:

* Attempt unauthorized access
* Exploit vulnerabilities found during scanning
* Techniques: password cracking, social engineering



### Maintaining Access:

* Establish persistent access to compromised system
* Bypass security mechanisms
* Set up backdoors or remote access tools



### Covering Tracks:

* Remove evidence of activities
* Delete logs, modify/remove files
* Restore system to original state



Ethical hacking must be conducted with proper authorization and in full compliance with legal requirements. Practitioners are bound by strict ethical guidelines and confidentiality agreements. It is crucial to obtain explicit permission from system or network owners prior to performing any penetration testing activities. This ensures the integrity of the process and maintains trust between ethical hackers and their clients.
