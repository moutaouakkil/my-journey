# Level 16 → 17

## Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to <mark style="color:orange;">a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000</mark>. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

**Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.**
